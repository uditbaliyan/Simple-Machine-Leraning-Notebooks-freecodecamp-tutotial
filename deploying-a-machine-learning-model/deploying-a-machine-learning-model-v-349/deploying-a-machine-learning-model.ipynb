    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an Instance of the Flask Class: Next, we will create an instance of the Flask class, commonly named `app`.

    "To fetch the API using ThunderClient, Insomnia, or Postman, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Open your API testing tool\n",
    "Launch ThunderClient, Insomnia, or Postman on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create a new request\n",
    "Create a new request by clicking on the \"New Request\" or \"New\" button in the tool's interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Set the request method and URL\n",
    "Set the request method to \"POST\" and enter the API URL in the request URL field. In this case, the URL is \"/api/predict\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Set the request body\n",
    "In the request body, enter the JSON payload with the \"content\" parameter and the email content. The payload should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"content\": \"Sample email content goes here.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace \"Sample email content goes here.\" with the actual email content you want to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Send the request\n",
    "Click the \"Send\" or \"Send Request\" button to send the API request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Process the response\n",
    "Once the request is sent, the API server will process it and send back a response. The response will contain the prediction and email content. Similar to this: \n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"prediction\": 1,\n",
    "    \"email\": \"Sample email content\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In ThunderClient and Insomnia, you can view the response in the tool's interface. "

    "Here are few things that can be implemented in the Future: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement authentication and user management: Add user authentication to the web application to ensure secure access and personalized experiences for users. This can include user registration, login, and account management functionality.\n",
    "- Scale the application for high traffic: Optimize the web application to handle increased traffic and concurrent user requests. This can involve deploying the application on a scalable infrastructure, such as using containerization technologies like Docker or utilizing cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    "- Implement APIs for model integration: Create APIs to expose the functionality of the email spam classification model, allowing other applications or services to integrate and make predictions using the deployed model.\n",
    "- Enhance user interface and user experience: Continuously improve the user interface and user experience of the web application by refining the design, layout, and usability. Incorporate user feedback to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
    "- Implement real-time updates: Enable real-time updates of the classification results as users input or modify email content. This can provide a more interactive experience and immediate feedback to users.\n",
    "- Integrate additional machine learning models: Extend the application's capabilities by integrating additional machine learning models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, or email categorization. This can provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools for managing and analyzing emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "These future work ideas can help further enhance the model deployment aspect of the email spam classifier web application and expand its capabilities to provide a more robust and versatile solution."
